    <h2>How I Got Into This</h2>
    <p>
      The first hike I went on was with my grandparents. They would bring me out
      on easy trails in the summer, and I quickly grew to love being outdoors.

      Over time, I started exploring longer hikes in the mountains and enjoyed
      challenging myself with steeper climbs and new views.
